感谢评论中 铬天青S 提到题目存在问题：
In the case of a tie, the lowest player_id wins
中文意思应为平局应该选择得分最低的选手

先直接show答案

SELECT group_id, player AS 'player_id'
FROM (
SELECT group_id, player, total
, IF(@preGroup = group_id, NULL, 1) AS flag
, @preGroup := group_id
FROM (
SELECT player, group_id, SUM(score) AS total
FROM (
SELECT first_player AS 'player', first_score AS 'score', group_id
FROM Matches
JOIN Players ON first_player = player_id
UNION ALL
SELECT second_player, second_score, group_id
FROM Matches
JOIN Players ON first_player = player_id
) t
GROUP BY player
ORDER BY group_id, total DESC, player
) t, (
SELECT @preGroup := NULL
) t2
) t
WHERE flag = 1;

说一下自己的思路

第一步
题目可以理解成求每组得分之和最大的player_id
所以Match表操作起来不容易，就先把他拆成两列
SELECT player, group_id, SUM(score) AS total
FROM (
SELECT first_player AS 'player', first_score AS 'score', group_id
FROM Matches
JOIN Players ON first_player = player_id
UNION ALL
SELECT second_player, second_score, group_id
FROM Matches
JOIN Players ON first_player = player_id
得到表



第二步
拿到表之后就计算每一个玩家的总和。
select player,group_id,sum(score) as total from
(select first_player as 'player',first_score as 'score',group_id
from Matches
join Players
on first_player=player_id
union all
select second_player,second_score,group_id
from Matches
join Players
on first_player=player_id
)t
group by player


第三步，优化第二步的表
让表进行排序
select player,group_id,sum(score) as total from
(select first_player as 'player',first_score as 'score',group_id
from Matches
join Players
on first_player=player_id
union all
select second_player,second_score,group_id
from Matches
join Players
on first_player=player_id
)t
group by player
order by group_id,total desc,player


观察可以看到每个id出现的第一行就是我们所需要的值

第四步引入临时变量
select group_id,player,total,IF(@preGroup=group_id,null,1) as flag,@preGroup:=group_id from
(select player,group_id,sum(score) as total from
(select first_player as 'player',first_score as 'score',group_id
from Matches
join Players
on first_player=player_id
union all
select second_player,second_score,group_id
from Matches
join Players
on first_player=player_id
)t
group by player
order by group_id,total desc ,player)t,(select @preGroup:=null)t2
得到

此时我们只要取flag=1的行即可完成
